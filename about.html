      <p>
        Hey! I’m Stevie, a videographer and photographer with a love for creating art and capturing people as their truest selves. 
        What started as a creative outlet has grown into one of my greatest passions, and every new project excites me. 
        I’m here to capture your favorite memories and beautiful moments so you can look back on them forever.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Denver and now live just outside the city with my husband and our two beautiful kids. 
        You’ll often find me lost in a good book or shaking cocktails for my favorite bar guests.
        In 2025, I became a certified video editor and picked up my first camera to start filming my own projects. 
        Since then, I’ve had the opportunity to work with the band CITRA, tagging along to film their shows and create music videos. 
        I’ve also filmed content for Southern Land Company and the locally owned business Beej.
        Along with videography, I offer photo sessions ranging from stylized portraits to maternity and engagement sessions. 
        I’m always excited to try new things and explore different creative directions.
